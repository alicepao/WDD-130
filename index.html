    <p>Hi, I'm Alice. I'm a junior studnet at BYU-Idaho studying Data Science.
        I'm from Taiwan and I love to meet new people and make friends. 
        One of my favorite things to do is hiking. Last summer, I went camping with my friends at Upper Paliside Lake. It was so much fun!

        I have one older sister who lives in Provo with her husband. Both of my parents are in Taiwan but they flew to Utah and spend the summer with us last year.
        I served my mission in Indiana and loved it. I met so many great people who helped me grow and learn. I'm so grateful for the opportunity to serve.
        After I graduate, I want to become a data analyst. The reason why I want to learn web development is because I want to be able to create my own website and share my thoughts and ideas with others.
        This skill will also come in handy when I have to do web scrapping. I'm excited to learn more about web development!
